# Personal Website
This repo is for my personal website. It is a full stack app that uses firebaseâ€™s auth and firestore DB. I have a user portal where I can add experience, projects, and blog posts (although I have the blog page just linking to medium until I can put some time into storing markdown files). Feel free to copy it (or portions of it) to build your own site!

This project was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
